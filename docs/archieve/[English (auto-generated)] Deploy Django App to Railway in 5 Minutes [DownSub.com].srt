00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,399
in this video let us see how to deploy

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,960
ajango project on playway so this is the

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,600
Jango project as you can see it is

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,960
running on the local Force let us see

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,759
how to deploy this project to the raway

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,120
it is similar to ver.com so let us see

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,640
how to deploy to this before we proceed

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,520
ahead we need to create some

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,519
configuration files so that raway can

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,039
deploy our project easily so this is my

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,199
jro project this is where my settings

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,240
that Bei is located and this is my jro

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,800
app we need to create the prop file the

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,360
file don't have any extension so this is

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,360
the file make sure you don't type any

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,559
extension then inside this we need to

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,280
copy and paste this I will provide the

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,640
link of this repository in the

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,960
description you can Che that out so let

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,920
me copy this and paste it in the prop

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,760
file here in the project name replace it

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,600
with your project name in this case

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,640
portfolio is me project name I will typ

24
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,160
that here

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
and also change that to portfolio now we

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,720
have created this stop file next we need

27
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,880
to create the run. text file here we

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,240
need to define the python version to get

29
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,920
the python version that is running on

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,320
your system open the terminal or command

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,680
front I'm going to open your terminal

32
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,479
here just type python iPhone iPhone

33
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,880
version this will give you the version

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,680
of python let me copy this python

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,920
version and paste it here

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,880
next we need to create the requirement.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,880
x file mandator you need to have the Gan

38
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,720
and the white noise so let me type the

39
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,560
requirements here the gicon and the

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
white noise are mandatory here because

41
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,320
using the white no we will save the

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,719
static

43
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,159
files so let's save this file also now

44
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,119
we have created these three files then

45
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:59,600
we need to change the settings we need

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,240
to add this white noes in the

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,560
settings.py file let me copy that and

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,439
open your settings.py

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,119
file here replace allow Force to Aster

50
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,480
because we don't know the URL on the

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,120
raway app so that's why we allow it to

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,920
Aster here in the middleware just P it

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,640
here through the White Noise We Will St

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,440
the static files because rway itself

55
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,920
don't serve the static files we will

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,840
save it through the white nice then at

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,519
the bottom of the file we need to add

58
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,599
another line so let me copy the second

59
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,120
line and paste it at the bottom of the.

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,319
pyi now we have completed the settings

61
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,319
that

62
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,040
file I think we have configured

63
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,360
everything let push it to the G up

64
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,239
