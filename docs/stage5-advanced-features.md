# Stage 5: Advanced Features & Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

Stage 5 enhances the RAG system with advanced features including conversation history tracking, analytics dashboard, query performance insights, and administrative tools for monitoring system usage and optimization.

## Features to Implement

### üóÇÔ∏è Conversation History Management
- **Session Tracking**: Track user query sessions and conversation threads
- **Query History**: Store all user queries with responses and context
- **Bookmarking**: Allow users to bookmark important queries and responses
- **Search History**: Search through previous conversations and results

### üìä Analytics Dashboard
- **Usage Statistics**: Document upload trends, query frequency, popular documents
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, embedding generation speeds, token usage
- **User Activity**: Per-user statistics and usage patterns
- **System Health**: Database performance, API response times, error rates

### üîç Advanced Search Features
- **Query Suggestions**: AI-powered query improvement suggestions
- **Faceted Search**: Filter by document type, date range, similarity threshold
- **Semantic Query Expansion**: Automatically expand queries with related terms
- **Multi-document Cross-referencing**: Find connections between documents

### üõ†Ô∏è Administrative Tools
- **System Configuration**: Adjust RAG parameters through web interface
- **Model Management**: Switch between embedding models and LLM providers
- **Bulk Operations**: Batch document processing and reindexing
- **Export/Import**: Data export for backup and migration

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Conversation History (Priority: High)
```python
# New Models
class QuerySession(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    session_id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4)
    started_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    last_activity = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

class ConversationHistory(models.Model):
    session = models.ForeignKey(QuerySession, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    query_text = models.TextField()
    response_text = models.TextField()
    documents_used = models.ManyToManyField(Document)
    similarity_threshold = models.FloatField()
    response_time_ms = models.IntegerField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### Step 2: Analytics Dashboard (Priority: High)
- Real-time usage metrics
- Performance monitoring charts
- Document usage heatmaps
- Query pattern analysis

### Step 3: Advanced Search (Priority: Medium)
- Query suggestion engine
- Semantic search enhancements
- Cross-document insights
- Search refinement tools

### Step 4: Admin Tools (Priority: Medium)
- Configuration management UI
- System health monitoring
- Performance optimization tools
- Data management utilities

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Conversation History**: All queries stored and searchable  
‚úÖ **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics and charts displayed  
‚úÖ **Advanced Search**: Query suggestions and faceted search working  
‚úÖ **Admin Tools**: System configuration accessible via web interface  

## Timeline

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
- Day 1: Conversation history and session management
- Day 2: Analytics dashboard and metrics collection
- Day 3: Advanced search features and admin tools
